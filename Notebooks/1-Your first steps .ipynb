    "The print above looks a little different, this is because two lists which are the output of the function glob are being printed. However, when it comes to loops there is another little trick that can make our code even shorter. This is called a **list comprehension**. A list comprehension is basically a for loop compressed into one line. It has some limitations compared to a for loop but its the most convinient way to iterate over loops. Can you figure out how we use the list comprehension to generate out list of lists of full paths to the images in the Type1 and Type2 directories?"
